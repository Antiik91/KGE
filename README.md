# Introduction
Kuikka Game Enhancer (KGE) is a modification created for Osasto Kuikka. It's designed to allow more control for admin to fix possible problems arising in middle of mission. 

Example when player dies on glitch like getting out of boat and thrown into air. With KGE admin can respawn that player back into game and mission can continue. Other example is JIP (join in progress) player. He/She would normally drive from base or someone will come to pick him/her up which takes time. With KGE admin can teleport him straight into selected position and continue mission.
